- Tasked to create a prototype of an app that solves an issue and creates a social impact
- Protoype of a mobile app that could be a guide in being financially literate in order to help with some of the stress students have had to face with managing money

With CreateRU being our first-ever designathon, my group and I learned a lot about using the design process, from user research to actual implementation on tools like Figma.
